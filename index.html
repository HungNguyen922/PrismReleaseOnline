        <h3>What is Prism Release?</h3>
        <p>Prism Release is a card game that seeks to play completely differently from any other card game on the market. It's been a passion project of mine for the past few years and I have put a lot of effort into making the game simple, but with lots of depth.</p>
        <h3>What makes Prism Release Unique?</h3>
        <p>I think the most interesting part of Prism Release is the emphasis on multiple different win conditions. You can play aggressive decks that attempt to reduce the opponent's health as quick as possible. You can play mill decks where your goal is to constantly play as many cards in a single turn as possible. You can play lock out decks that attempt to prevent any plays from being made on the board. The goal is to have something for everyone.</p>
        <p>Another interesting aspect of Prism Release is the lack of card costs and card's being associated with up to 4 colors. No card costs places more emphasis on the cards themselves being the driving factors of the game. Each color has its own identity to the ways they play. However, with cards potentially having multiple colors associated with them, it makes games much more dynamic and diverse in terms of what you can see in any given deck.</p>
